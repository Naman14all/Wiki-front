                        <p class="paras"><b>Peafowl</b> is a common name for two bird species in the genera <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pavo_(bird)" class="linkintext2">Pavo</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congo_peafowl"class="linkintext2">Afropavo</a> within the tribe Pavonini of the family <a href="#" class="linkintext">Phasianidae</a> (the pheasants and their allies). Male peafowl are referred to as <b>peacocks</b>, and female peafowl are referred to as <b>peahens</b>, although peafowl of either sex are often referred to <a href="#" class="linkintext">colloquially</a> as "peacocks".</p><br>
                        <p class="paras">The two Asiatic species are the blue or <a href="#" class="linkintext">Indian peafowl</a> originally from the <a href="#" class="linkintext">Indian subcontinent</a>, and the <a href="#" class="linkintext">green peafowl</a> from Southeast Asia; The <a href="#" class="linkintext">Congo peafowl</a> is not a true peafowl, native only to the <a href="#" class="linkintext">Congo Basin</a>. Male peafowl are known for their piercing calls and their extravagant plumage. The latter is especially prominent in the Asiatic species, which have an eye-spotted "tail" or "train" of <a href="#" class="linkintext">covert feathers</a>, which they display as part of a <a href="#" class="linkintext">courtship</a> ritual.
                        </p><br>
                        <p class="paras">The functions of the elaborate <a href="#" class="linkintext">iridescent</a> colouration and large "train" of peacocks have been the subject of extensive scientific debate. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Darwin" class="linkintext">Charles Darwin</a> suggested that they served to attract females, and the showy features of the males had evolved by <a href="#" class="linkintext">sexual selection</a>. More recently, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amotz_Zahavi" class="linkintext">Amotz Zahavi</a> proposed in his <a href="#" class="linkintext">handicap principle </a>that these features <a href="#" class="linkintext">acted as honest signals</a> of the males' fitness, since less-fit males would be disadvantaged by the difficulty of surviving with such large and conspicuous structures.</p><br>
                        <p class="paras">A group of peacocks is called an "ostentation" or a "muster".<a href="#" class="linkintext">[1]</a></p><br>

                            <div class="paras">The Indian peacock (Pavo cristatus) has iridescent blue and green plumage, mostly metal-like blue and green. In both species, females are a little smaller than males in terms of weight and wingspan, but males are significantly longer due to the "tail", also known as a "train".[2] The peacock train consists not of tail quill feathers, but highly elongated upper tail coverts. These feathers are marked with eyespots, best seen when a peacock fans his tail. All species have a crest atop the head. The Indian peahen has a mixture of dull grey, brown, and green in her plumage. The female also displays her plumage to ward off female competition or signal danger to her young.</div><br>
                            <div class="paras">Male <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_peafowl" class="linkintext">green peafowl</a> (Pavo muticus) have green and bronze or gold plumage, and black wings with a sheen of blue. Unlike Indian peafowl, the green peahen is similar to the male, but has shorter upper tail coverts, a more coppery neck, and overall less iridescence. Both males and females have spurs.[3]</div><br>
                            <div class="paras">The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congo_peafowl" class="linkintext">Congo peacock</a> (Afropavo congensis) male does not display his covert feathers, but uses his actual tail feathers during courtship displays. These feathers are much shorter than those of the Indian and green species, and the ocelli are much less pronounced. Females of the Indian and African species are dull grey and/or brown.</div><br>
                            <div class="paras">Chicks of both sexes in all the species are cryptically coloured. They vary between yellow and tawny, usually with patches of darker brown or light tan and "dirty white" ivory.</div><br>
                            <div class="paras">Mature peahens have been recorded as suddenly growing typically male peacock plumage and making male calls.[4] Research has suggested that changes in mature birds are due to a lack of estrogen from old or damaged ovaries, and that male plumage and calls are the default unless hormonally suppressed.[5]</div>

Optical <a href="#" class="linkintext">interference Bragg reflections</a>, based on regular, periodic nanostructures of the barbules (fiber-like components) of the feathers, produce the peacock's colours. 2D photonic-crystal structures within the layers of the barbules cause the colouration of their feathers.[6] Slight changes to the spacing of the <a href="#" class="linkintext">barbules</a> result in different colours. Brown feathers are a mixture of red and blue: one colour is created by the periodic structure and the other is created by a Fabry–Pérot interference peak from reflections from the outer and inner boundaries. Color derived from physical structure rather than pigment can vary with viewing angle, causing iridescence.[7]

                            <div class="paras">Most commonly, during a courtship display, the visiting female peahen will stop directly in front of the male peacock – thus providing her the ability to assess the male at 90° to the surface of the feather. Then, the male will turn and display his feathers about 45° to the right of the sun's azimuth which allows the sunlight to accentuate the iridescence of his train. If the female chooses to interact with the male, he will then turn to face her and shiver his train so as to begin the mating process.[8]

                            <div class="paras">Multiple hypotheses involving female choice have been posited. One hypothesis is that females choose mates with good genes. Males with more exaggerated secondary sexual characteristics, such as bigger, brighter peacock trains, tend to have better genes[example needed] in the peahen's eyes.[12] These better genes directly benefit her offspring, as well as her fitness and reproductive success.
                            </div><br>
                            <div class="paras">Runaway selection is another hypothesis. In runaway sexual selection, linked genes in males and females code for sexually dimorphic traits in males, and preference for those traits in females.[13] The close spatial association of alleles[which?] for loci[which?] involved in the train in males, and for preference for more exuberant trains in females, on the chromosome (linkage disequilibrium) causes a positive feedback loop that exaggerates both the male traits and the female preferences.
                            </div><br>
                            <div class="paras">Another hypothesis is sensory bias, in which females have a preference for a trait in a nonmating context that becomes transferred to mating, such as Merle Jacobs' food-courtship hypothesis, which suggests that peahens are attracted to peacocks for the resemblance of their eye spots to blue berries.[14]</div><br>
                            <div class="paras">Multiple causality for the evolution of female choice is also possible.</div><br>
                            <div class="paras">The peacock's train and iridescent plumage are perhaps the best-known example of traits believed to have arisen through sexual selection, though with some controversy.[15] Male peafowl erect their trains to form a shimmering fan in their display to females. Marion Petrie tested whether or not these displays signalled a male's genetic quality by studying a feral population of peafowl in Whipsnade Wildlife Park in southern England. The number of eyespots in the train predicted a male's mating success. She was able to manipulate this success by cutting the eyespots off some of the males' tails:[16] females lost interest in pruned males and became attracted to untrimmed ones. Males with fewer eyespots, thus with lower mating success, suffered from greater predation.[17] She allowed females to mate with males with differing numbers of eyespots, and reared the offspring in a communal incubator to control for differences in maternal care. Chicks fathered by more ornamented males weighed more than those fathered by less ornamented males, an attribute generally associated with better survival rate in birds. These chicks were released into the park and recaptured one year later. Those with heavily <div class="img-between-data">

                            </div> ornamented feathers were better able to avoid predators and survive in natural conditions.[18] Thus, Petrie's work shows correlations between tail ornamentation, mating success, and increased survival ability in both the ornamented males and their offspring. A peacock in flight: Zahavi argued that the long train would be a handicap.
                                Furthermore, peafowl and their sexual characteristics have been used in the discussion of the causes for sexual traits. Amotz Zahavi used the excessive tail plumes of male peafowls as evidence for his "handicap principle".[19] Since these trains are likely to be deleterious to an individual's survival (as their brilliance makes them more visible to predators and their length hinders escape from danger), Zahavi argued that only the fittest males could survive the handicap of a large train. Thus, a brilliant train serves as an honest indicator for females that these highly ornamented males are good at surviving for other reasons, so are preferable mates.[20] This theory may be contrasted with Ronald Fisher's hypothesis that male sexual traits are the result of initially arbitrary aesthetic selection by females.</div><br>
                                <div class="paras">In contrast to Petrie's findings, a seven-year Japanese study of free-ranging peafowl concluded that female peafowl do not select mates solely on the basis of their trains. Mariko Takahashi found no evidence that peahens preferred peacocks with more elaborate trains (such as with more eyespots), a more symmetrical arrangement, or a greater length.[11] Takahashi determined that the peacock's train was not the universal target of female mate choice, showed little variance across male populations, and did not correlate with male physiological condition. Adeline Loyau and her colleagues responded that alternative and possibly central explanations for these results had been overlooked.[21] They concluded that female choice might indeed vary in different ecological conditions.
